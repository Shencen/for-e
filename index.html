        <h1>Happy Birthday, my lovely pookie boo!!!!!!</h1>
        <p>My dear Eva,</p>
        <p>
            From the moment I met you (heheheh), I knew you were someone truly special, and that we would get along pretty well... And when I actually had the change
            to talk to you, that hunch proved itself to be true!! >.<
        </p>
        <p>
            You are the most amazing person I know, never in my life I met someone that clicked so perfectly with me, the way we always laugh at each other's jokes without
            feeling judged... You are so perfect in every single way, and I am so, so, so, SO happy to have the opportunity to talk with you. &lt;3
        </p>
        <p>
        I wish to be able to be with you a lot of birthdays, not just this one... And maybe, one day, to spend one of those birthdays with you, holding your hand, staring into your face...
        </p>
        <p>
        And kissing you. &lt;3
        </p>
        <p>
        I made this for you, it's not something really impressive, I know... But I made this to make you remember just how awesome you are, and to make you remember that you deserve
        a lot of nice stuff, please, enjoy your birthday, my love, and keep looking at the future with your bright, precious smile. MWAH. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

            With all my love, your dear Isaac!
